# SCN_Representational_Drift
spike coding network simulations of representational drift

instructions:

1) installation of conda and python dependencies as indicated in environment.yaml via "conda env create -f environment.yaml", typical install time on the order of minutes

3) adjust setup.py to reflect your paths for saving simulation and figures

4) run RD.py file (for shorter simulations adjust number of days Tdays and number of simulations Nsim before run)

5) output: simulation of SCN activity across days & figures
